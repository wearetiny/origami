==========================

Welcome to Origami, where your CSS and SCSS code folds and unfolds like the ancient art of paper folding! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨

It's like magic for your stylesheets, making them easy to read and manage in a 'minified-like' style. Ideal for developers who adore a clean, streamlined view of their code!

Features
--------

-   Fold and Unfold: With a simple command or keybinding, toggle your CSS/SCSS between a single line and multi-line format.
